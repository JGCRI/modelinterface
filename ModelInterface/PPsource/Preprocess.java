/**
 * MASTER TODO LIST: *currently COMPLETE, RUNNING and CORRECT to the best of my knowledge*
 * TODO: look into ways to optimize memory usage, possible replace of merge operation as this doubles
 * used memory size by building a seperate tree before the merge happens (maybe implement addDate as previously discussed)
 * 
 */
/* DEVELOPER COMMENTS
 * thoughts on addData: the idea of adding new data to an existing tree is a pretty good one, could work in
 * the same exact manner as merge does now, but on a block by block basis. oh wait, actually i guess not. hmm. Ok so,
 * if the res of the main tree is <= the adding data then your fine, because you extract and your. DAMNIT wrong again
 * ok, so the problem is that regardless of res the blocks might not line up correctly. so when you say extract data you
 * have to weight it, but can we use the same weighting algorithm as in merge? need to look into that. regarless, say we
 * can extract by block as in merge. the problem then becomes one of order. with a user defined resolution, or static res,
 * or even if the first data set read is at the sharpest res were fine. but if for some reason a data set with a lower res
 * is added first then theres a problem. there is no mechanism for reResing a tree so to speak, so we are stuck with
 * whatever resolution we start with, the only way to get around this would be to rebuild a new tree and merge in
 * key word there is merge, if you need this operation your saving absolutly no space.
 * There is the consideration of time however. building a whole new tree THEN merging every element kindof sucks. if we
 * could only merge on a lower resolution the rest could be done 'by block' this would be essentially the same bigO of
 * merge, but there would be no tree creation time (which is probably large). this is definately something to look into
 * if only for the speedup, im going to do some speed tests to see which parts of the program take the most time.
 * in the meantime this is on the bottom of the list, speed isnt of the utmost importance in this part of the tool.
 * 
 * hahaha, i think building the tree takes like... 95% of the time, soooo yeah ill def look into this
